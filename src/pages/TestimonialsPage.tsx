        quote: "Always wanted to train calisthenics from many years since I got to know about it, but never found a place which teaches calisthenics here in assam. But 3 months ago while randomly searching calisthenics on googlemap, when I came to know about califit, I immediately joined within a week. Since last 3 months while training this art, it has hit muscle groups of my body, which has never been activated before in my life. And being a body weight training and which requires so much less equipments and such small space, this much result in a short period of time is quite astonishing. But this art requires good guidance,, for which trainers in califit Mr. Bhaskar Saud and Mr. Avinash is quite remarkable.",

The best part about calisthenics I have experienced is that the strength and skills one builds here is transferable to other activities like running, rock climbing and boxing. This would never have been possible through traditional gym equipment based workouts. Finally, to top it all, one has a very motivated and cool coach (Bhaskar) to guide you through it!",
